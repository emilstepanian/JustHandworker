# JustHandworker
JustHandworker created for the Copenhagen Business School bachelor courses "Development of Larger Information Systems" (https://kursuskatalog.cbs.dk/2017-2018/BA-BINTO1006U.aspx) and "Definition of Information Systems" (https://kursuskatalog.cbs.dk/2017-2018/BA-BINTO1004U.aspx)

The project is supposed to show capabilities in systems development in a larger context, understanding how to develop with the object-oriented perspective and how to set the user first and think of an effective UX experience.

JustHandworker is a Android-prototype of the idea which tries to create a two-sided shared economy platform where professionals can offer services for private users.
